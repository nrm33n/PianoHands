Based on Memo Atken's <a href="https://www.memo.tv/works/webcam-piano-2/">Webcam Piano</a> research project.


It tracks movement by comparing the pixels from each frame to the next. The green square indicates which area had a high enough change in pixels to be noticed. The difference required for this can be changed using the slider above. 

Then, the tiles present in that area are shown. A piano note corresponds to each tile which is played when it is "touched", allowing a user to essentially play an instrument in midair.
